Dataset and sample size: March 2016, 1,576,000 instances

DBSCAN has great advantages over K-mean in that it doesnâ€™t not require the user to specify the number of clusters, it works great for geographical data, and it allows some observations to be grouped as outliers, as opposed to all categorize them into some clusters.

The most lucrative pick up places are as followed:  

   Area 1: La Guardia Airport. Marked in green color.
