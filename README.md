Dataset and sample size: March 2016, 1,576,000 instances

DBSCAN has great advantages over K-mean in that it doesnâ€™t not require the user to specify the number of clusters, it works great for geographical data, and it allows some observations to be grouped as outliers, as opposed to all categorize them into some clusters.

The most lucrative pick up places are as followed:  

   Area 1: La Guardia Airport. Marked in green color.

   Area 2: Upper Manhattan, marked in blue color. Especially the area around Harlem.  From w111th street to w134th.

   Area 3: Broadway Ave, from W95th street to W105th street. Marked in Black

   Area 4: Marked in purple:  northern part to Columbia University, from north of Columbia University to the southern edge of City college of New York. 

   Area 5: Northeastern corner of the Central park, especially E110th street to E112th street. (Marked in Red)
